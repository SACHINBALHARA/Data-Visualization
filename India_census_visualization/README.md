# India Census 2011 Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the India Census 2011 dataset. The dataset provides detailed information on population demographics, literacy, workforce, religious composition, education, and age groups across districts and states of India. The analysis involves exploring various trends and relationships using data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

District_code: Unique code for the district

State_name: Name of the state

District_name: Name of the district

Population: Total population of the district

Male: Total male population

Female: Total female population

Literate: Total literate population

Workers: Total workforce

Male_Workers: Total male workforce

Female_Workers: Total female workforce

Cultivator_Workers: Total cultivator workers

Agricultural_Workers: Total agricultural workers

Household_Workers: Total household workers

Hindus: Population of Hindus

Muslims: Population of Muslims

Christians: Population of Christians

Sikhs: Population of Sikhs

Buddhists: Population of Buddhists

Jains: Population of Jains

Secondary_Education: Number of people with secondary education

Higher_Education: Number of people with higher education

Graduate_Education: Number of people with graduate education

Age_Group_0_29: Population in the age group 0-29

Age_Group_30_49: Population in the age group 30-49

Age_Group_50: Population aged 50 and above

Objectives and Key Questions

The analysis addresses the following key questions:

## 1. Demographics and Population

What is the distribution of the population across different states?

How do male and female populations vary across districts?

What is the ratio of male to female population for each state?

Which districts have the highest and lowest populations?

## 2. Literacy

What is the literacy rate distribution across districts?

How does the literacy rate compare between states?

Is there a correlation between literacy and the number of workers in a district?

## 3. Workers

What is the proportion of male and female workers in each district?

How does the number of workers vary across different states?

What is the distribution of cultivator workers across districts?

How do agricultural workers compare to household workers in different districts?

What is the relationship between total workers and population in a district?

## 4. Religion

What is the distribution of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains in the dataset?

How does the religious composition vary across states?

Are there districts where a single religion dominates significantly?

## 5. Education

What is the distribution of secondary education levels across districts?

How does the percentage of people with higher education vary across states?

What is the relationship between literacy rate and graduate education?

Which states or districts have the highest levels of secondary, higher, and graduate education?

## 6. Age Groups

How is the population distributed across age groups (0-29, 30-49, 50+) in different districts?

What is the proportion of each age group within a state's population?

Is there a relationship between age group populations and education levels?

## 7. Comparison Between Attributes

What is the relationship between male workers and female workers across districts?

Is there a correlation between the number of workers and religious composition in a district?

How does the number of cultivator workers relate to the number of agricultural workers?

## 8. Geographical Trends

Are there regional trends in literacy, population, or worker distribution across districts?

How do states differ in terms of household workers as a proportion of the total population?

## 9. Top-N Analysis

Which are the top 10 districts with the highest literacy rates?

What are the top 10 districts with the most male or female workers?

Which districts have the highest percentage of a particular religion?
